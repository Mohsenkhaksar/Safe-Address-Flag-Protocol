## 🛡 What is SAFP?

**SAFP** is a proposed open standard that adds a structural safety flag to blockchain wallet addresses.  
Its purpose is to distinguish between:

- ✅ **Spendable addresses** (with private keys)
- 🚫 **Non-spendable or vanity addresses** (e.g., burn addresses, fake slogans, scams)

This helps wallets and exchanges prevent users from accidentally or maliciously sending assets to irreversible addresses.
